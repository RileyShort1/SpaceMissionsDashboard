# SpaceMissionsDashboard
An interactive dashboard to visualize and analyze historical space mission data from 1957 onwards.

## Tech Stack
Python + Streamlit  
I picked this tech stack because both Python and Streamlit are simple to use and therefore fast  
to prototype with.  

## Running the App  
To run the app, make sure you have streamlit, pandas, and plotly installed.    
You can run it with the command "python -m streamlit run app.py"
