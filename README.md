# SpaceMissionsDashboard
An interactive dashboard to visualize and analyze historical space mission data from 1957 onwards.

## Tech Stack
Python + Streamlit  
I picked this tech stack because both Python and Streamlit are simple to use and therefore fast  
to prototype with.  

## Running the App  
To run the app, make sure you have streamlit, pandas, pytest, and plotly installed.    
You can run it with the command "python -m streamlit run app.py"  

## Note on Testing  
The tests in the instruction document did not seem to match with the data in the csv file  
(in csv NASA has 203 missions, but doc example says 394)
